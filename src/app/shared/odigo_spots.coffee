However, a hidden gem is the Tourist Information Center on the second floor. There are actually two of them; one focusing solely on Tokyo and the other on Japan in its entirety. At these centers, you can ask the staff any questions you may have, pick up free maps and brochures, free magazines like the Metropolis, and acquire any other travel information for almost every tourist destination in any of Japan’s prefectures.

no better place to celebrate a special occasion than at Cafe Gray, on the 49th floor of the Upper House Hotel. The interior is elegant with subtle Asian influences, and the windows give a spectacular view of Victoria Harbor. The table bread is among the best I’ve ever tried: baked with sesame seeds and served warm, with a yogurt and olive oil dip. Cafe Gray’s cuisine is homey yet gourmet, with carefully culled ingredients. Try the set menu, which has a wine pairing for each dish. One memorable pairing was the plancha seared kingfish chimichurri with fennel and peppers, served up with a glass of 2012 Dry Riesling. Tip: time your dinner so that you can catch the 8pm “Symphony of Lights” show, where skyscrapers like the ICC glow with moving images.

of the busiest Starbucks locations in the world, the Shibuya store overlooks the “scramble crossing” at the Hachiko Exit of Shibuya JR station. Although the second floor has seating and a great view of the crossing, it can often be difficult to find an open seat. Since it gets really crowded, your coffee order can take a long time as well.\u003cbr /\u003eI found that buying a coffee at the little Starbucks kiosk around the corner and then wandering up to the 2nd floor to grab a seat was much quicker than waiting in line on the 1st floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n","zh":"\u003cp\u003eundefined\u003c/p\u003e\n"},"photos":[],"user_icon":"https://trip-planner.s3.amazonaws.com/development/profile/avatar/53546de569702d147a040000/icon_IMG_0735.JPG","big_user_icon":"https://trip-planner.s3.amazonaws.com/development/profile/avatar/53546de569702d147a040000/big_icon_IMG_0735.JPG","username":"Wouter

of my favorite places in Japan also just happens to be a good 700 km away from Tokyo. Hidden away in the often ignored Shimane prefecture, the Adachi Art Museum remains to date one of the finest museums and gardens I have ever visited.\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr /\u003eThe Japanese-style gardens have consistently claimed the top honor as ‘Best Garden in Japan’ since 2003, and this ranking is well-deserved. The deftly placed rocks, raked sand and manicured greenery are a vision of perfection, unmarred by crowds of amateur photographers. Thanks to large picture windows, the museum harmoniously combines the gardens and art collection, which features a rather fine selection of 20th century Japanese art. As the collection rotates constantly to suit the seasonal scenery, the Adachi Art Museum truly embodies the ‘ichi go ichi e’ aesthetic, so each time you go it will be a unique experience.\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr /\u003eAn hour away from Matsue, getting to the museum is quite a trek.
